Some notes on installing pyrtlsdr.


On Mac
------
Not available from conda?

pip install pyrtlsdr




On the Raspberry Pi
-------------------

The python portion seems to install without error using

sudo pip install pyrtlsdr

However:

>>> from rtlsdr import RtlSdr
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "rtlsdr/__init__.py", line 56, in <module>
    from .librtlsdr import librtlsdr
  File "rtlsdr/librtlsdr.py", line 52, in <module>
    f = librtlsdr.rtlsdr_get_device_count
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/ctypes/__init__.py", line 378, in __getattr__
    func = self.__getitem__(name)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/ctypes/__init__.py", line 383, in __getitem__
    func = self._FuncPtr((name_or_ordinal, self))
AttributeError: python: undefined symbol: rtlsdr_get_device_count

PROBABLY because librtlsdr is not installed.

I note that cmake is not installed on the pi, so ...

Download cmake-3.9.0.tar.gz from https://cmake.org/download/

mv ~/Downloads/cmake-3.9.0.tar.gz .
tar -xvzf cmake-3.9.0.tar.gz cmake-3.9.0/
cd cmake-3.9.0/
./bootstrap
make
sudo make install

(these steps are VERY slow)



libusb seems to be already installed, but the wrong version (?).  Get the "right" one:

pi@raspberrypi:~/librtlsdr/build $ sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0-0
Reading package lists... Done

libusb-1.0-0 is already the newest version.
libusb-1.0-0 set to manually installed.
0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 206 not upgraded.

Then follow Paul's instructions, BUT:

cmake ../ -DINSTALL_UDEV_RULES=ON -DDETACH_KERNEL_DRIVER=ON
