Battery supplies 14.5 - 15 V (fully charged) at a maximum of 5.4 A
Total power is then about 75 W

Raspberry Pi

The Pi Model B (current version) needs 1.2 A and can supply
500 mA total USB draw

The Pi3 Model B is 2.5 A and 1.2 A from the USB. 

So Pi / Pi3 would draw 0.5/1 A at 12 V, assuming 100% efficiency on
the voltage conversion.

We are running an Arduino and mouse / keyboard.  No idea what the
current draw is for the mouse / keyboard.  Mouse 5 V / 100 mA, but
keyboard says 5 V / 1.5 A (seems high)

Arduino Uno is either powered from USB (5 V, current up to the limit
of the Pi), or externally.  Recommendations are 9 - 12 V, 0.5 - 1 A
(!) depending on what you're doing.  20 mA per I/O pin.  We're
currently using 13 I/O pins.  The 3.3 V power (for the sensor card)
will add another 50 mA.  Altogether sounds like ~300 mA (1.5 W).  Does
that make sense?

Finally, the motors draw up to 2 A / phase at 3.2 V.  An upper limit
on the power draw is then ~12 W.  The board is operated at 15 V, so it
must be pulling ~1 A if it were 100% efficient.  Assume the board
draws 1.5 - 2 A.

Empirically, we seem to need about 900 mA - 1 A at 14 V for just the
motors (with the elevation drive drawing significantly more current
(about 500 mA) than the elevation drive (~100 mA).  The "motors off"
current is about 250 mA for the two boards.
